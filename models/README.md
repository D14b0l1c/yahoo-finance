# ðŸ“‚ models/

This folder contains trained machine learning models stored in serialized format (`.pkl`, `.keras`, etc.).

These models are generated by scripts in the `/scripts` directory and used for predictions or visualizations.

### Files:
- `linear_regression.pkl` â€“ Linear Regression model trained on PE Ratio, Return on Equity, Beta, and EPS.
- `random_forest_regressor.pkl` â€“ Random Forest model trained for improved robustness and non-linearity handling.
- `xgboost_regressor.pkl` â€“ XGBoost model optimized for high accuracy on financial fundamentals.
- `arima_forecast.pkl` â€“ ARIMA model trained on historical stock closing prices for time series forecasting.
- `logistic_regression.pkl` â€“ Logistic Regression model classifying next-day movement (up/down).
- `lstm_forecast.keras` â€“ LSTM deep learning model predicting future closing prices based on 10-day history.
