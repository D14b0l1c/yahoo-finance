# 📈 Yahoo Finance Predictive Modeling

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to analyze financial data pulled from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.

---

## ✅ Implemented Models

### 🧮 1. Linear Regression
### 🌲 2. Random Forest Regressor
### ⚡ 3. XGBoost Regressor
### 📉 4. ARIMA (Time Series Forecasting)
### 📈 5. Logistic Regression
### 🔁 6. LSTM (Deep Learning Sequential Prediction)
### 🧠 7. k-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Grouping)
### 🔍 8. Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)

All models are saved, visualized, and included in the `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
